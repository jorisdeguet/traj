      <h1>Who?</h1>

      <p>The original idea was incepted by <strong>Marie-Claude Dupont</strong> and <strong>Joris Deguet</strong>.</p>
      <p>Joris Deguet is the primary developer for Traj.</p>
      <p>You can contact me at <strong><em>joris dot deguet at gmail dot com</em></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Andres Ahumada</strong> took care of the spanish translation.</p>

      <h1>What?</h1>
      <p>There is no company behind Traj. It is just an idea that was implemented
      for personal use first. Now we share it.</p>
      <p>The idea was twofold :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>to add geographic data to a timeline</li>
        <li>to allow anyone to build such a geographical timeline (we prefer to call it a <strong>traj</strong>) </li>
      </ul>
